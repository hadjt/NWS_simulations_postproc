This file includes the regional mean time-series for a selection of variables (as RegAveSST, RegAveSSS etc. for the regional mean SST and SSS respectively), for each month, and each of the 14 regions. There are variables for the region id (reg_id) and the number of grid boxes within each region (cnt). The region mask included (mask, with the associated longitude and latitude variables). This methodology is described by Tinker et al. (2019; see region_methology_reference)."

out_comment_grid = 'Note that NEMO uses the Arakawa "C" grid, where the T, U and V grids are offset. Most variables are on the T grid, apart from the Eastward and Northward components of the ocean barotropic current, which are on the U and V grids respectively. We also provide the barotropic current speed on T grid, where we transform the U and V velocity components onto the T grid, before calculating their magnitude. We therefore separate the variables on the T, U and V grids into separate files. This file contains variables on the %s grid.'


out_comment_EnsStat = 'These ensemble statistics are calculated from the climatological mean and standard deviation for each NWSPPE ensemble member, which in turn are based on the monthly mean values calculated from every timestep, as output by NEMO shelf version 4.0.4. For a given climatological period (e.g. 2000-2019, 2079-2098), and month, season or year, the climatological mean and standard deviation of all 12 NWSPPE ensmeble members are loaded. The mean of these climatological means gives the Ensemble Mean (ensmean). The variance of the climatological means gives the Ensemble Variance (ensvar), and its square-root gives the Ensemble Standard Deviation (ensstd). The mean of climatological standard deviation squared (i.e. the climatological variance) gives the Interannual Variance (intvar). Each variable (SST, SSS, NBT, etc.) has 4 statistic associated with it, and the NetCDF variable names join the variable name (e.g. SST) with the statistic name (e.g. ensmean), separated by an underscore. For example the ensmeble mean SST is SST_ensmean and the NBT interannual variability is NBT_intvar. This is all captured in the "cell_methods", where "realization" denotes the ensemble members. The Ensemble Variance and Interannual Variance can be combined into the Total Variance following Tinker et al. 2016; see variance_separation_references).'
